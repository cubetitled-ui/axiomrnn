07_generate.py -- train a spiking language model, then let it write.

Run:
    python examples/07_generate.py

WHAT THIS IS
    05_t9.py shows the model's opinion about the next word given a prefix.
    That is a suggestion, not a generation. This file closes the loop: it feeds
    the model's own output back in, one token at a time, and prints what it
    writes. A language model that cannot be sampled from is a classifier with a
    softmax on the end.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY CLAIMED
    The generated text is not good. The model is small, the context is six
    words, and the corpus is 115k words of one novel. What this file demonstrates
    is mechanical: the framework assembles a recurrent network whose hidden
    state is carried by binary spikes, that network trains through keras.fit on
    ordinary text, and it can then be sampled from token by token.

    If the samples below were fluent English with a plot, that would be a lie
    about what was measured. Read them as evidence that generation runs, and read
    the held-out numbers as the only real quality statement.

MEASUREMENTS REPORTED
    - held-out next-word accuracy against a majority-word baseline
    - cross-entropy in bits per word, which is comparable across models in a way
      accuracy is not
    - the same two numbers for a frequency baseline, so there is something to
      compare against besides intuition
    - samples at three temperatures, because temperature changes what a model
      says and a single sample proves very little
