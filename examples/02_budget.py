02_budget.py -- the budget as an INPUT to design.

Run (TensorFlow is NOT needed):
    python3 examples/02_budget.py

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS EXAMPLE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The first example showed that a network learns. This one is about
something else.

Usually you learn about memory AFTER the fact: you assemble, you train,
it dies with OOM, you shrink it, you retrain. axiomrnn reverses the
order: you say how much memory you have, and you get back an answer about
what can be learned with it.

How this differs from the alternatives:

  Accelerate  takes max_memory, but only for inference
  JAX         demands a manual commitment
  PyTorch     measures post-factum
  ONNX        does not accept a budget at all

Here the budget is the input and the answer is human-readable: "at 6 GB
there is 4.12 usable, this network needs 0.78, credit horizon 66".

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS FILE RUNS WITHOUT TENSORFLOW
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
That is not a coincidence, it is a check of an architectural boundary.
`axplan` does not import TF at all, so the planner runs on a machine with
no GPU stack. Verify it: run this file with the same system `python3`
that has no TF installed.

# a trap).
#
# What is shown here is REAL behaviour, including where the planner
# refuses. That matters more than a pretty picture.
#
# The cost is honest: each segment has an INPUT (which must be stored to
# reproduce the segment) and INTERNAL activations (the forward peak).

#

#
#   room = budget - max(segment internal activations)
#
# So INSIDE a segment the planner does not cut. If one segment's internals
# exceed the budget the answer is None, and no partition helps: you have
# to restructure the model yourself, splitting that piece into smaller
# layers.
#
# The bottom rows of the table above are exactly this case: the graph input
# (3 GiB) has to be stored, and at a 2 GiB budget there is no answer at all.

print("""
  THE PLANNER:
    - does NOT scale the network automatically. It costs what you already
      described and tells you whether it fits;
    - does NOT cut inside a segment (see point 4);
    - is optimal, verified against exhaustive search on 307 tasks, and the
      greedy algorithm wins on none of them.

  THE MEMORY MODEL:
    - was checked by measurement on an RTX 3050: plan/actual = 0.99;
    - on DIFFERENT hardware the ratio will be its own thing. Measure, do
      not trust.

  WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW (and do not invent):
    - the sparse/bit crossover point, measured by nobody, us included;
    - what a spiking network really costs in energy. We have no such
      hardware here to measure it on;
    - whether a spiking network is faster on a GPU. We measured parity in
      quality (0.994 against 0.999) and did NOT measure superiority.
