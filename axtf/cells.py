axtf.cells -- custom recurrent neuron for Keras/TF.

The project core. Users may override it, which is exactly what you cannot
do with a frozen Keras layer:

    class MyCell(SpikingCell):
        def membrane(self, state, x, t): ...      # your dynamics
        def spike_fn(self, u, thr): ...           # your spike rule

and get `SpikingRNN(MyCell)` without forking the framework.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE ONE THING THAT MUST HOLD
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
With mean readout, the learning curve must NOT depend on T. If it does,
the 1/T gradient normalisation is lost and training diverges on long
horizons.

Verified by the gate (axon/gate.py):
    ||g|| norm_t=True:   T=4:0.301  T=16:0.356  T=64:0.414   (1.18x)
    ||g|| norm_t=False:  T=4:0.658  T=16:3.557  T=64:11.4     (5.40x)

This is not cosmetic. Without 1/T, accuracy FELL with horizon: 0.92 -> 0.06.
Three such bugs in a row cost us a full session, so 1/T is baked into the
core and cannot be switched off by accident.

THREE PLACES WHERE THE MATH BREAKS SILENTLY
===========================================
1. 1/T normalisation -- see above. norm_t.
2. Reset. u_t = leak*u_{t-1} + cu; s_t = 1[u_t > thr]; u_t <- u_t*(1-s_t).
   u_t appears TWICE (spike and reset), so
       d st_t/du_t = (1-s_t) - u_t*sigma'(u_t-thr).
   Dropping that term gave ~30% gradient error.
3. Reset path in the threshold gradient. The threshold enters both s_t and
   st_t, so
       dL/dthr = -sum A_t*sigma'_t + sum (leak*U_{t+1})*u_t*sigma'_t.
   Without the second term it is simply wrong.

The surrogate gradient CANNOT be checked on the hard model: 1[u>thr] is
piecewise constant, so its derivative is identically zero. Hence smooth=True,
where finite differences are meaningful.

    WHY EXPLICIT, AND NOT A PLAIN LOOP
    ==================================
    A time loop over ordinary TF ops breaks the autograd graph: TF cannot
    connect T state steps into one differentiable chain. The symptom is
    nasty -- the model builds fine, loss falls from 7.4 to 1.38, and then
    FREEZES. The gradient is zero and nothing raises.

    So the backward pass is explicit, and it is the same code verified
    against finite differences in test_tf_cells.py.

    FOUR RULES WITHOUT WHICH custom_gradient DOES NOT WORK
    =====================================================
    1) grad_fn must return (input_grads, variable_grads) -- a TUPLE of two
       lists, not one flat tuple. Flat gives "too many values to unpack".
    2) A gradient is required for EVERY input. For a non-trainable threshold
       return zeros_like, not None, or you get "Must return gradient for
       each variable".
    3) keyword arguments (variables=) work ONLY in eager mode. Keras
       Functional builds a GRAPH, and TF raises "custom_gradient decorator
       currently supports keywords arguments only when eager execution is
       enabled". So kernel/threshold are passed as ORDINARY inputs rather
       than through variables=, which works in both modes.
    4) compute_output_shape is required for Functional: without it Keras
       cannot infer the shape and fails while still building the graph.

    What is lost: Keras cannot take a second derivative. We do not care --
    time-wise BPTT needs an explicit backward regardless.
