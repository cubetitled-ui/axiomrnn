"""
axtf.build -- assemble a real Keras model from an axiomrnn spec.

The single place where our layer becomes part of a Keras graph. The user
writes:

    model = ax.Model()
    model.add_spiking(256, horizon=8)
    model.add_spiking(128, horizon=8)
    model.add_dense(10)
    km = model.keras_model(inputs=..., outputs=10)

and gets an ordinary Keras model that compiles and trains like any other.

WHAT WE DO NOT BUILD
====================
Layers? No, Keras has them. Optimizer? No. Training loop? No. Autodiff? No.
Serialization? No.

We add exactly five things:
  1. memory model (axplan)
  2. planner (axplan)
  3. diagnostics
  4. a few kernels
  5. explain()

Reason: TF/Keras are mature, so everything here is something they
fundamentally do not do.

    """Turn spikes into a continuous signal for the output layer.

    Two modes. The choice is not cosmetic -- it is a measured difference.

      'mean'    : average over time. Independent of T, compact.
      'flatten' : whole sequence. T enters the input dimension.

    MEASURED (verify_14, RTX 3050, T=16, width=256, 2 layers, threshold
    scanned, trunk parameters equal):

        dense (MLP)              0.9981
        spiking, readout=flatten 0.9912   <- nearly matches dense
        spiking, readout=mean    0.7356

    So the spiking net DOES solve the task, and the 0.26 gap is not bit-ness
    at all -- it is loss of temporal resolution in the mean. Checked
    separately: replacing the hard 1[u>thr] with a smooth one under mean
    readout gives 0.7475 vs 0.7356, so bit-ness costs 0.012 and everything
    else is the readout.

    Hence the 'flatten' default. 'mean' stays because for tasks that do not
    depend on exact timing it is more compact and keeps T out of the input
    dimension -- but it must be chosen deliberately.

    The 1/T normalisation for 'mean' is the part that needs an explicit
    gradient fix, which SpikingRNNCell (norm_t) does rather than hoping
    Keras infers it.
