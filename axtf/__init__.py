"""axtf -- the only package that knows about TensorFlow and Keras.

Contains the spiking cell, the Keras layer, and model assembly. If a rule
belongs to training or assembly, it lives here and nowhere else.

The cell classes are re-exported here so that exactly one import spelling works:

    from axtf import SpikingRNNCell

`axtf.cells` remains the implementation module and is still importable, but a
user should not have to know which of the two is the public one. When
TensorFlow is absent the names still exist and refuse on use with the command
that fixes it, because a name that vanishes on import teaches nothing and a name
that is silently None produces "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable",
which reads as a bug in this package rather than a missing dependency.
