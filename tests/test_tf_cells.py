TESTS FOR THE TF CORE (axtf.cells).

The point here is NOT that it runs, but that it runs CORRECTLY. The
gradient is checked twice:

  1. against the numpy kernel axon/lif.py, whose gradient is already
     proven by finite differences (rel.err ~1e-8, axon/gate.py);
  2. against finite differences directly, on the smooth model.

Why: three backward-pass bugs surfaced in the numpy kernel in one night
(see the lif.py docstring). Had we written the TF layer and only checked
that the loss fell, the same three bugs would have passed unnoticed.

TF lives in a separate venv: /home/cune/.venvs/ax

# ═══ 3b. THE membrane_dstate HOOK ═════════════════════════════════════════
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# The backward pass used to read `cell.leak` directly as du_{t+1}/dstate.
# That is correct for the default LIF and WRONG for every subclass that
# changes the membrane -- silently: nothing raises, and the loss still
# falls a little, so nobody finds out until the model is mysteriously worse
# than a baseline it should have beaten.
#
# So SpikingCell grew a `membrane_dstate` hook and the kernel now asks the
# cell instead of assuming.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT TESTED WITH FINITE DIFFERENCES ON THE LAYER
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The first version of this test did exactly that, and reported rel.err
# 0.98 on correct code. Reason, already documented in section 2 above: the
# hard 1[u>thr] is piecewise constant, so the loss is discontinuous and
# central differences return noise, not the derivative. A test that reads
# 0.98 on correct code teaches you to distrust the test.
#
# So the hook is checked two ways instead, both on things that CAN be
# checked exactly:
#
#   1. membrane_dstate against finite differences OF THE MEMBRANE ITSELF,
#      which is smooth for any sane cell;
#   2. a call counter, so a kernel that ignored the hook and went back to
#      reading cell.leak would fail rather than pass quietly.
