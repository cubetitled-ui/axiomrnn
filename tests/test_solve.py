"""
Tests for the capacity solver (axplan.solve).

The claim under test is NOT "the solver finds the true optimum". The claim is
narrower and checkable:

  1. every configuration it reports as fitting really fits, when the memory
     model is evaluated independently;
  2. the configuration it reports as NOT fitting really does not fit -- an
     optimiser that only ever returns successes cannot be distinguished from
     one that is simply optimistic;
  3. it is monotone in the knobs the memory model is monotone in;
  4. it refuses to answer rather than answering when nothing fits.

No quality claim is tested here because the package makes none (UX_RULES 10).
