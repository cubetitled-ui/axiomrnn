"""
Tests for the segmentation planner.

The main check is to PROVE optimality: every partition by exhaustive search
against the DP, on a pile of random tasks. verify_1_dp_v2 already did this
on 2500 cases; here we fix it as a framework regression test so that nobody
breaks the optimality "in memory".

We also compare against a GREEDY algorithm (as in memopt), so there is a
reproducible number for "how much do we win over greedy".
