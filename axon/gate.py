axon.gate -- THE GATE. Nothing gets published until this is green.

Why this file exists: in one session I produced confident nonsense three
times in a row, and every time the bug was in the TEST RIG rather than the
formulas:
  - threshold calibrated with reset switched off -> "accuracy falls with T"
  - gradient not normalised by 1/T               -> "accuracy falls with T"
  - (a third one, an earlier run, also in the rig)

The checks below catch that class in seconds. Run:

# ═══ 1. GRADIENT vs FINITE DIFFERENCES ═══════════════════════════════════

def test_finite_difference(n_probe=80, seed=3):
    """Analytic gradient against central finite differences.

    IMPORTANT, AND THIS WAS A BUG IN THE FIRST GATE: checking the
    surrogate gradient against the HARD forward pass is meaningless --
    1[u>thr] is piecewise constant, so its derivative is zero everywhere
    except at the kinks. Finite differences return EXACTLY 0 for any eps,
    and any correct implementation would "fail".

    The right thing to check is the SMOOTH model (smooth=True): there
    s = sigma(u-thr), the reset is soft, the function is smooth, and our
    backward pass is its true gradient. That is what we check.

    This is not a technicality but a substantive fact about the method: a
    surrogate gradient is NOT the derivative of the hard function (and
    cannot be), it is the gradient of the smoothing. Any check of a
    surrogate must therefore run on the smooth model.

    Catches: a forgotten 1/T, a wrong sign in the reset, a wrong surrogate,
    non-recursive accumulation over time, an error in dL/dthr.

    This is a direct, decisive check of bug 15, not an indirect one.

    Why: with mean readout (readout = 1/T * sum_t s_t) the maths requires
    dL/ds_t = (1/T) * dL/dreadout. The backward pass sums contributions over
    T steps, so without 1/T the gradient grows LINEARLY in T. At a fixed
    learning rate a larger T means a T-times larger step and training
    diverges. That is where "accuracy falls with T: 0.92 -> 0.06" came from.

    We measure ||g|| on THE SAME weights at different T:
      norm_t=True  -> ||g||(T) is roughly constant
      norm_t=False -> ||g||(T) grows like T

    No training, no calibration -- a pure property of the formula, so the
