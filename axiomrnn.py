axiomrnn -- a framework where memory budget is an input, not a surprise.

Quick start (beginner, no neuromorphic AI background needed):

    import axiomrnn as ax

    model = ax.Model()
    model.add_spiking(256, horizon=64)     # looks like Keras
    model.add_spiking(128, horizon=64)
    model.add_dense(10)

    model.explain(ax.Budget.consumer_6gb())   # <- the actual difference
    km = model.keras_model(inputs=x, outputs=10)

What explain() does: it does not answer "does it fit", it answers "**what
can you learn** on this budget". No existing tool answers that.

Extending without forking:

    class MyCell(ax.SpikingCell):
        def membrane(self, state, drive, thr):
            return state + drive

    model = ax.Model(cell=MyCell())        # the whole stack works at once

Layers know TF through axtf; the planner (axplan) does not know TF at all.
