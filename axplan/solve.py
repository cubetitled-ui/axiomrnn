"""
axplan.solve -- the inverse question.

Everything else in axplan answers "what does THIS network cost?". This module
answers the question a practitioner actually has: **"I have this much memory.
What is the largest network I can train?"**

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
The package's value is the planner, not the spiking. A planner that only
reports the peak of a fixed architecture leaves the user to guess which knob
to turn. This module searches the knob space under the verified memory model
and reports the boundary exactly, together with the reason it is a boundary.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
================================
It does not rank quality. There is **no verified quality model in this
package**, and inventing one would be the single most damaging thing this
codebase could do -- see UX_RULES.md 10. The one quality figure that does
exist is the price of the local credit rule, `credit.local_quality()`, which
is read from a cited measurement and returns None outside its data range
rather than extrapolating. That function is used here, and only there.

So the answer is a CAPACITY answer, stated as such: the largest configuration
whose predicted peak fits, plus the first configuration that does not fit.
The second half matters. A tool that only reports what fits cannot be
distinguished from a tool that is simply optimistic.

THE BOUNDARY IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED
=====================================
Feasibility is monotone in `hidden` (every memory term grows with width), so a
binary search would be valid. The implementation scans anyway: monotonicity is
an assumption about the model, and an assumption that silently stops holding
would turn the search into a lie. The scan is cheap enough that correctness is
the better trade.
