axplan.planner -- memory planner.

The problem: given a graph of M segments and a memory budget, choose
rematerialisation boundaries so that
    (1) the exact peak memory does not exceed the budget, and
    (2) total recompute time is minimal.

This is a partitioning problem, not gradient descent: an exact solution is
available in polynomial time, so we take it rather than approximating.

WHY DP AND NOT GREEDY
=====================
memopt (Le et al., MLSys'24) solves it greedily, sweeping left to right and
cutting as rarely as possible. We measured the greedy answer losing to the
optimum. DP over the Pareto front gives a PROVEN optimum:

  verify_1_dp_v2.py -> 2500/2500 partitions matched exhaustive search,
                       0 budget violations, monotone in the budget.

MEMORY MODEL (derived from checks, not invented)
================================================
Only each segment's INPUT is stored: inp[b_0], inp[b_1], ..., inp[b_{M-1}].
During backward of segment k these are live:

      live_k = SUM_{j >= k-1} inp[b_j]  +  inter[seg_k]

Exact peak: peak = max_k live_k. It is NOT convex in the boundaries, so it
cannot be optimised directly.

CONSERVATIVE UPPER BOUND (convex in the boundaries):
      peak <= SUM_{b in boundaries, b < M} inp[b]  +  max_t inter[t]

Key observation: max_k (max_{t in seg_k} inter[t]) = max_t inter[t] does
NOT depend on the partition. The boundary sum is therefore additive and an
ordinary 1D DP applies.

That was the v1 bug: "how many inputs are stored" depends on the CHOSEN
partition, not just on j, so the DP transition was wrong. Fixed.

ABOUT HONESTY OF THE BOUND
=========================
The conservative figure is an upper bound, so it always yields a feasible
plan -- but it can be suboptimal for the exact model. The size of that gap
is measured in verify_1_dp_v2 (point C) and reported to the user, not hidden.
