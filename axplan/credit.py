axplan.credit -- credit assignment rules and their price in bytes.

This is what we LEFT OUT of the first memory model, and it turned out to be
the single largest correction of the whole project. We had modelled only
BPTT and assumed tape memory was set by the horizon and the codec. Both
assumptions are wrong as the MAIN levers.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MAIN FINDING (measured, not invented)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    fp32 Adam m+v = 8 B/param
    e-prop (LIF)  = 4 B/synapse   -- does NOT depend on T at all
    e-prop (ALIF) = 8 B/synapse
    ALIF+reward   = 12 B/synapse

So on a fixed architecture, switching BPTT -> e-prop costs in BYTES about
the same as switching momentum on -- not like changing paradigms.

More important: the real cliff is T, not S.
    BPTT:  Theta(T * A)   grows with the horizon
    e-prop: Theta(S)      does not grow

Quality price measured (FPTT, Yin/Corradi/Bohte):
    T=60  -> 85.5%
    T=500 -> 38.9%
    a 47-point gap on long horizons

COMPLEXITY CLASSES (three different ones, do not mix them)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Theta(S)  per synapse: e-prop, OSTL, ETLP, OSTTP
    Theta(N)  per neuron:  DECOLLE, OTTT, S-TLLR, TESS
    Theta(T*A):            BPTT

No biologically plausible rule reaches O(1) PER SYNAPSE. e-prop buys
Theta(S) instead of Theta(T*A) -- enormous, but the byte multiplier over
Adam stays under 1.5x.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
No paper publishes bytes-per-synapse. The 4/8/12 B table is DERIVED from
the equations in Nature Communications 11:3625 (e-prop), with the
derivation in /home/cune/local-learning-memory-report.md section 3.

On SOLO: 2B parameters in 26.7 GB at K=4 -- the only billion-scale result
in local learning. But it is depth-local, not temporally local, and is NOT
evidence that e-prop scales to 1B.
